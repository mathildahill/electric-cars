The goal of the `sfcr` package is to provide an intuitive and `tidy` way to estimate stock-flow consistent (SFC) models with R. 

## Installation

`sfcr` is on CRAN and can be installed with:

``` r
install.packages("sfcr")
```

For the development version available on [GitHub](https://github.com/), use the `devtools` package for installation:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joaomacalos/sfcr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows how to simulate the "SIM" model from @godley2007monetary [ch. 3], as well as how to add scenarios to this baseline model.

The `sfcr_set()` function is used to create define the equations and external variables of the model.

These sets are used to simulate the baseline scenario of the model with the `sfcr_baseline()` function:

```{r example}
library(sfcr)

eqs <- sfcr_set(
  TXs ~ TXd,
  YD ~ W * Ns - TXs,
  Cd ~ alpha1 * YD + alpha2 * Hh[-1],
  Hh ~ YD - Cd + Hh[-1],
  Ns ~ Nd,
  Nd ~ Y / W,
  Cs ~ Cd,
  Gs ~ Gd,
  Y ~ Cs + Gs,
  TXd ~ theta * W * Ns,
  Hs ~ Gd - TXd + Hs[-1]
)

external <- sfcr_set(
  Gd ~ 20, 
  W ~ 1,
  alpha1 ~ 0.6,
  alpha2 ~ 0.4,
  theta ~ 0.2
  )

sim <- sfcr_baseline(
  equations = eqs, 
  external = external,
  periods = 60, 
  
  )

sim
```

With the steady state values at hand, we can use the `sfcr_scenario()` function to see what happens if we increase government expenditures `Gd` from 20 to 30:

```{r}
shock <- sfcr_shock(
  variables = sfcr_set(
    Gd ~ 30
  ),
  start = 5,
  end = 60
)

sim2 <- sfcr_scenario(
  baseline = sim,
  scenario = shock,
  periods = 60
  )

sim2
```

With `sfcr`, the models are written entirely within R and use the standard R syntax. Furthermore, their output is a `tibble`, meaning that it can be easily manipulated with `dplyr` and other `tidyverse` tools and plotted with `ggplot2`.

Check the [notebooks](https://joaomacalos.github.io/sfcr/articles/) that replicate the models in @godley2007monetary for more detailed examples on the usage of the package.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can you add exogenous time series to a `sfcr` model?**

A: Since version 0.2, the `sfcr` package recommends the utilization of exogenous time series only in the `sfcr_scenario()` function. This functionality is going to be excluded from `sfcr_baseline()` function in the future because it led to unexpected behavior when calculating scenarios on the top of those baseline models.

The exogenous series can be added to the model with the help of `sfcr_shock()` and `sfcr_set()` functions. It is further required that the length of the exogenous time series being supplied be either 1 or exactly equal to length of the shock.

For example, the code supplied above can be modified to make `Gd` increase from 30 to 40 between periods 1 and 60 of the scenario:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr) # for select() and everything() functions

shock <- sfcr_shock(
  variables = sfcr_set(
    Gd ~ seq(30, 40, length.out=60)
  ),
  start = 1,
  end = 60
)

sim2 <- sfcr_scenario(
  baseline = sim,
  scenario = shock,
  periods = 60
  )

select(sim2, period, Gd, everything())

```

**Q: How to add random variation to endogenous variables?**

A: The recommended way to add random variation to endogenous variables is with the `sfcr_random()` function. This function can only be used inside `sfcr_set()`, be it when you're creating a set of exogenous variables or when defining the variables inside a `sfcr_shock()`. The advantage of utilizing this function is that it smartly guesses the length of the models, avoiding any unwanted mistake.

The `sfcr_random()` function can accept three arguments as its first `.f` argument: `"rnorm"`, `"rbinom"`, and `"runif"`. These arguments implement wrappers around the built-in functions `rnorm()`, `rbinom()`, and `runif()` -- random series generator function -- but guessing the correct length of the `sfcr_baseline()`, `sfcr_scenario()`, or `sfcr_shock()` from where they are called. The `sfcr_random()` function also accepts any extra argument that can be passed to these functions.

Snippet:

```{r}
sfcr_set(
  Ra ~ sfcr_random("rnorm", sd=0.05)
)
```


An utilization of this functionality in practice is provided in the article replicating the Portfolio Choice model from @godley2007monetary [ch. 4].

Alternatively, the direct utilization of the random generator functions from `stats` are still allowed to ensure the compatibility with the v0.1.1 of the package. Nonetheless, the user must be careful when using this functionality at the `sfcr_baseline()` level since this expression is going to be evaluated again at the `sfcr_scenario()` level. The safest way to use these functions is by passing `periods` instead of an integer as their first argument.

Snippet:
```{r}
# Not recommended but work:
sfcr_set(
  Ra ~ rnorm(periods, sd=0.05)
)

# NOT RECOMMENDED!
sfcr_set(
  Ra ~ rnorm(60, sd=0.05)
)
```


**Q: Can you add endogenous variables with more than one lag?**

A: Yes, you can, but you need to use auxiliary variables. 

For example, say that you want to modify model SIM to have Consumption `Cd` in period `t` defined as function of the moving average of disposable income. In this situation, you would have to code the variables as:

```{r}
eqs <- sfcr_set(
  TXs ~ TXd,
  YD ~ W * Ns - TXs,
  YDlag1 ~ YD[-1],
  YDlag2 ~ YDlag1[-1],
  YDlag3 ~ YDlag2[-1],
  YDmav ~ (YD + YDlag1 + YDlag2 + YDlag3) / 4,
  Cd ~ alpha1 * YDmav + alpha2 * Hh[-1],
  Hh ~ YD - Cd + Hh[-1],
  Ns ~ Nd,
  Nd ~ Y / W,
  Cs ~ Cd,
  Gs ~ Gd,
  Y ~ Cs + Gs,
  TXd ~ theta * W * Ns,
  Hs ~ Gd - TXd + Hs[-1]
)
```

### Acknowledgments

I'm grateful to Severin Reissl for his very useful comments and for always pointing me in the right direction, to Marc Lavoie for answering all my questions about SFC modeling, and to Italo Pedrosa for our discussions about the state of the SFC field.
