# Model INSOUT

We'll start this model by writing down the balance sheet matrix:

```{r}
bs_insout <- sfcr_matrix(
  columns = c("Households", "Firms", "Government", "Central bank", "Banks", "Sum"),
  codes = c("h", "f", "g", "cb", "b", "s"),
  r1 = c("Inventories", f = "+INV", s = "+INV"),
  r2 = c("HPM", h = "+Hhd", cb = "-Hs", b = "+Hbd"),
  r3 = c("Advances", cb = "+As", b = "-Ad"),
  r4 = c("Checking deposits", h = "+M1h", b = "-M1s"),
  r5 = c("Time deposits", h = "+M2h", b = "-M2s"),
  r6 = c("Bills", h = "+Bhh", g = "-Bs", cb = "+Bcb", b = "+Bbd"),
  r7 = c("Bonds", h = "+BLh * pbl", g = "-BLs * pbl"),
  r8 = c("Loans", f = "-Ld", b = "+Ls"),
  r9 = c("Balance", h = "-V", f = 0, g = "+GD", cb = 0, b = 0, s = "-INV")
)

sfcr_matrix_display(bs_insout, "bs")
```

And the transactions-flow matrix:

```{r}
tfm_insout <- sfcr_matrix(
  columns = c("Households", "Firms current", "Firms capital", "Govt.", "CB current", "CB capital", "Banks current", "Banks capital"),
  codes = c("h", "fc", "fk", "g", "cbc", "cbk", "bc", "bk"),
  c("Consumption", h = "-C", fc = "+C"),
  c("Govt. Expenditures", fc = "+G", g = "-G"),
  c("Ch. Inv", fc = "+(INV - INV[-1])", fk = "-(INV - INV[-1])"),
  c("Taxes", fc = "-TX", g = "+TX"),
  c("Wages", h = "+WB", fc = "-WB"),
  c("Entrepreneurial profits", h = "+FXf", fc = "-FXf"),
  c("Bank profits", h = "+FXb", bc = "-FXb"),
  c("CB profits", g = "+FXcb", cbc = "-FXcb"),

  c("int. deposits", h = "+rm[-1] * M2h[-1]", bc = "-rm[-1] * M2h[-1]"),
  c("int. bills", h = "+rb[-1] * Bhh[-1]", g = "-rb[-1] * Bs[-1]", cbc = "+rb[-1] * Bcb[-1]", bc = "+rb[-1] * Bbd[-1]"),

  c("Ch. M2", h = "-(M2h - M2h[-1])", bk = "+(M2s - M2s[-1])"),
  c("Ch. bills", h = "-(Bhh - Bhh[-1])", g = "+(Bs - Bs[-1])", cbk = "-(Bcb - Bcb[-1])", bk = "-(Bbd - Bbd[-1])"),

Let's start with the external variables of the model as they are crucial to solve the model.

First, it is important to calculate consistent values of the `lambda` parameters. I'll start from [Zezza's](http://gennaro.zezza.it/software/eviews/v6/gl10insout.prg) parameters. However, his definition of `lambda21`, `lambda31`, and `lambda41` are not consistent with the horizontal constraints.

To remedy the problem, I erased these values and recalculate them with the explicit help of the constraints:

```{r}
# Note: there's a mistake in Zezza's parameters lambda11, lambda21, lambda31,
# and lambda41.

lambda20 = 0.52245
lambda22 = 30
lambda23 = -15
lambda24 = -15
lambda25 = -0.06
lambda30 = 0.47311
lambda32 = -15
lambda33 = 30
lambda34 = -15
lambda35 = -0.06
lambda40 = 0.17515
lambda42 = -15
lambda43 = -15
lambda44 = 30
lambda45 = -0.06

lambda10 <- 1 - (lambda20 + lambda30 + lambda40)
#lambda10

lambda15 <- -(lambda25 + lambda35 + lambda45)
#lambda15

# lambda31 = - (lambda33 + lambda32 + lambda34)
lambda31 <- -(lambda33 + lambda32 + lambda34)

# lambda41 = - (lambda44 + lambda42 + lambda43)
lambda41 <- -(lambda44 + lambda42 + lambda43)

# lambda21 = - (lambda22 + lambda23 + lambda24)
lambda21 = -(lambda22 + lambda23 + lambda24)
cat("lambda21: ", lambda21, "\n")
cat("lambda31: ", lambda31, "\n")
cat("lambda41: ", lambda41, "\n")

lambda12 = lambda21
lambda13 = lambda31
lambda14 = lambda41

lambda11 = -(lambda12 + lambda13 + lambda14)

# Print their values to screen:
new_lambdas <- c(lambda10 = lambda10, 
                 lambda11 = lambda11, 
                 lambda12 = lambda12, 
                 lambda13 = lambda13, 
                 lambda14 = lambda14, 
                 lambda15 = lambda15)

iwalk(new_lambdas, ~cat(.y, ": ", .x, "\n"))
```

With the new `lambda` values at hand, we can write down the external variables

```


As usual, let's make a helper function to simplify the plotting:

(programming tip: keep coming back to this function and adding the names and the transformations you want. The final version will have all the transformations you use in your analysis)


```{r}
do_plot <- function(model, variables) {
  
  # The lookup_names table has the code of the variables
  # and the name I wanted displayed in the Figures.
  
  
  lookup_names <- tribble(
    ~name, ~Var,
    "dBhh", "HH. Bills",
    "dV", "Wealth",

    "rm", "Interest on term deposits",
    "rb", "Interest on bills",
    "rl", "Interest on loans",
    "rbl", "Interest on bonds",
    "dLs", "Loans",

  model %>%
    mutate(yr = y / y[1],
           cr = c / c[1],
           dV = V - V[1],
           dM1s = M1s - M1s[1],
           dM2s = M2s - M2s[1],
           dBhh = Bhh - Bhh[1],
           dHhs = Hhs - Hhs[1],
           dBLh = (pbl * BLh) - (pbl[1] * BLh[1]),
           dLs = Ls - Ls[1],
           M = M1s + M2s,
           dM = M - M[1],
           dAs = As - As[1],
           dHbs = Hbs - Hbs[1],
           dBbd = Bbd - Bbd[1],
           dGb = -1 * (PSBR - PSBR[1]),
           dPSBR = PSBR / p,
           tav = (p - lag(p)) / p,
           gr = ((p - lag(p)) * (lag(Bs) + lag(BLs) * lag(pbl)) - PSBR) / p,
           gr2 = (tav * (lag(Bs) + lag(BLs) * lag(pbl)) - PSBR) / p,
           gr3 = (tav * (lag(Bs) - lag(Bcb) + lag(BLs) * lag(pbl) - lag(As)) - PSBR)/p,
           BYR = (Bs + pbl * BLs) / Y,
           dCB = Bcb - lag(Bcb),
           ddAs = As - lag(As)
           ) %>%
    select(period, all_of(variables)) %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = -period) %>%
    # Left-join the lookup_names table
    left_join(lookup_names, by = "name") %>%
    mutate(Var = if_else(is.na(Var), name, Var)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = period, y = value)) +
    geom_line(aes(color = Var)) +
    scale_color_brewer("Variable", type = 'qual', palette = "Dark2")
}
```

We are now ready to estimate the model:

```{r}
insout <- sfcr_baseline(
  equations = insout_eqs,
  external = insout_ext,
  periods = 210,
  initial = sfcr_set(p ~ 1, W ~ 1, UC ~ 1, BPM ~ 0.0035),
  hidden = c("Hbd" = "Hbs"),
  tol = 1e-15
)
```


Fulfilling the hidden equation is a good sign. But did the model arrive to a sensible steady state?

```{r}
insout %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -period) %>%
  filter(name %in% c("Y", "y", "s", "inv", "pi", "Bs", "M1s", "M2s", "V", "INV", "FXf", "FXb")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = period, y = value)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "INSOUT", subtitle = "Stable steady state")
```

So far, so good. But what about the variables that depend on `bot`, `top`, `botpm`, `toppm`? We need to check that the margins are not too tight. If they are, BLRN becomes a ping pong, as in the example below:

```{r}
insout_ext$top <- top ~ 0.03
insout_ext$bot <- bot ~ 0.02

pingpong <- sfcr_baseline(
  equations = insout_eqs,
  external = insout_ext,
  periods = 200,
  initial = sfcr_set(p ~ 1, W ~ 1, UC ~ 1),
  hidden = c("Hbd" = "Hbs"),
  tol = 1e-25,
  method = "Broyden"
)

# Some values are cut out given the limits I set to this plot
pingpong %>%
  do_plot(variables = c("BLRN", "bot", "top")) +
  ylim(-0.1, 0.1)
```

Ping pong is bad because it prevents a stable steady state where we wanna run our scenarios.

Setting `top` to 0.1 solves the problem:

```{r}
insout %>%
  do_plot(variables = c("BLRN", "bot", "top")) +
  ylim(0, 0.1)
```


What about `BPM` and `toppm` and `botpm`?

```{r}
insout %>%
  do_plot(variables = c("BPM", "toppm", "botpm")) +
  ylim(0, 0.01)
```

Here we see that the margins are fine.

We can use the `sfcr` package to visualize the transactions-flow matrix as a Sankey's diagram:

```{r}
sfcr_sankey(tfm_insout, insout, "start")
```

Let's take a look at the structure of this model:

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.width=11}
p1 <- sfcr_dag_cycles_plot(insout_eqs, size = 7.5) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
p1
```


As can be seen, this model is entirely acyclical.

This plot shows a common problem in plotting SFC models as DAGs: they become too cluttered to be understandable. I provided a small workaround by changing the size of the points in the plots.


Let's add scenarios to this model:

## Simulation 1: An increase in the targeted inventories to sale ratio

```{r}
shock1 <- sfcr_shock(
  variables = sfcr_set(
    sigma0 ~ 0.4
  ),
  start = 5,
  end = 70
)

insout1 <- sfcr_scenario(
  baseline = insout,
  periods = 70,
  scenario = list(shock1)
)
```


```{r}
insout1 %>%
  do_plot(variables = c("INV", "Ls")) +
  labs(title = 'INSOUT1',
       subtitle = "Evolution of inventories and bank loans")
```

```{r}
insout1 %>%
  do_plot(variables = c("yr", "cr")) +
  labs(title = "INSOUT1",
       subtitle = "Evolution of real consumption and output")
```

```{r}
insout1 %>%
  filter(period > 2, period < 10) %>%
  do_plot(variables = c("dV", "dBhh", "dBLh", "dM1s", "dM2s", "dHhs")) +
  #facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "INSOUT1",
       subtitle = "Evolution of household wealth and its components")
```

I'll run one sensitivity test here to show that there's nothing in the model that prevents the interest rate on deposits to become higher than the interest rate on bills:

```{r}
sigma0 <- seq(0.37, 0.55, 0.02)

m.shock1 <- sfcr_expand(shock1, "sigma0", sigma0)

m.insout1 <- sfcr_multis(
  expanded = m.shock1,
  fixed = insout, 
  periods = 70
  )
```

```{r}
library(RColorBrewer)

mypal <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(6, "GnBu")[3:6])
mypal2 <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(6, "OrRd")[3:6])

m.insout1 %>%
  bind_rows() %>%
  group_by(simulation) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(period, simulation)) %>%
  filter(name %in% c("rm")) %>%
  mutate(inter = interaction(as_factor(simulation), as_factor(name))) %>%
  #mutate(inter = as.numeric(inter)) %>%
  #mutate(inter = interaction(simulation, name)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = period, y = value)) +
  geom_hline(color = "darksalmon", yintercept = 0.023, size = 1.5, alpha = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(color = inter), size = 1.5, alpha = .9) +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  #facet_wrap(~simulation, scales = "free_y") +
  #scale_colour_steps() +
  scale_color_manual("Sigma 0", 
                     values = c(mypal(length(sigma0))),
                     labels = paste0(sigma0)) +
  annotate("text", x = 4, y = 0.0235, label = "Rate on bills") +
  annotate("text", x = 47, y = 0.027, label = "Rate on deposits") +
  labs(title = "INSOUT1",
       subtitle = "Evolution of short-term interest rates") +
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(alpha = 1)))
  
```

This experiment shows that nothing **prevents** the interest rate on deposits to cross the interest rate on bills. However, one should also wonder about the economic meaning of the different `sigma0` values when judging the model.

## Simulation 2: An increase in pure government expenditure

Let's increase the real pure government expenditures by 20%:

```{r}
shock2 <- sfcr_shock(
  variables = sfcr_set(
    g ~ 30
  ),
  start = 5,
  end = 55
)


insout2 <- sfcr_scenario(insout, list(shock2), periods = 55, tol = 1e-15)
```

```{r}
insout2 %>%
  do_plot(variables = c("c", "v", "ydr")) +
  labs(title = 'INSOUT2',
       subtitle = "Evolution of HH. real consumption, disp. income, and wealth")
```

```{r}
insout2 %>%
  #mutate(PSBR = PSBR / p) %>%
  do_plot(variables = c("dPSBR", "PSBR")) +
  labs(title = "INSOUT2",
       subtitle = "Evolution of deflated PSBR")
```

The next experiment checks the impact of an increase in government expenditures on the inflation rate. When I first tried this experiment, I defined `Nfe` as `s / pr`, as in model DISINF. With this definition, I was getting the strange result that an increase in `g` was actually deflationary. When I defined `Nfe` as an exogenous variable, the result was similar to the one found in @godley2007monetary.

The reason is that `g` directly affect `s` is model INSOUT. Hence, an increase in `g` directly increase `Nfe`, while `N` reacts with a lag. The increase in the gap `N / Nfe` negatively affects `omegaT` (the target real wage of workers), which will ultimately lead to lower `W` and hence lower `UC`, affecting `NHUC` which ultimately affects `p`.

```{r}
insout2 %>%
  do_plot(variables = c("pi")) +
  labs(
    title = "INSOUT2",
    subtitle = "Evolution of the price inflation rate"
  )
```


The following figure replicates Figure 10.2D in @godley2007monetary [p. 353]. However, I'm almost certain that there is a typo in the *real government budget balance* definition.

In the book, it is defined as:

$$
gr = \frac{-PSBR + (\Delta p) \cdot (B_{s-1} + BL_{s-1} * p_{bL-1})}{p}
$$

I think that the correct definition should be:

$$
gr2 = \frac{-PSBR + tav \cdot (B_{s-1} + BL_{s-1} * p_{bL-1})}{p}
$$

where $tav = (\Delta p) / p$.


```{r}
insout2 %>%
  do_plot(c("gr", "gr2", "gr3")) +
  labs(title = "INSOUT2",
       subtitle = "Evolution of the real budget balance",
       caption = "Takes into account the capital gains due to the erosion of the public debt\n by price inflation.")
```

A possible third definition would remove the bills and the advances held by the BCB from the inflation capital gains. It seems reasonable to me and consistent with equation 10.96 [@godley2007monetary] [p. 368] that describes the steady state with inflation:

$$
g + \breve{r} \left[ v - in \cdot \frac{UC}{p} \right] - tav \left[ v - in \cdot \frac{UC}{p} \right] = \frac{T}{p} 
$$

However, as can be seen above, it does not converges to zero (although converges to a steady state). In the remaining of this notebook, I will use `gr2` definition
