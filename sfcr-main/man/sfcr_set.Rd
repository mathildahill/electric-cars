\title{Define the formulas of the model}
\usage{
sfcr_set(..., exclude = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{The formulas used to define the equations and external
values of the system}

\item{exclude}{One or more indices of equations to be excluded. The
correct indices can be found with \code{sfcr_set_index()}.}
}
\description{
The \code{sfcr_set()} function is used to create the lists of equations,
external variables, initial values, and also to modify the variables inside
the \code{sfcr_shock()} function.
}
\details{
This function is a S3 generic that applicable to only two inputs: \code{formula} and
\code{sfcr_set}. It is used to create a new set of equations or to modify an existing
one.

Therefore, the equations must be written using the R formula syntax, i.e., the left-hand
side of each equation is separated from the right-hand side with a \code{~} ("twiddle")
instead of a \code{=}.

Furthermore, the \code{sfcr_set()} function recognizes two symbols that are not
native to R language: \code{[-1]}, and \code{d()}.
\itemize{
\item If a variable defined with \code{sfcr_set()} is followed by \code{[-1]}, it will
be recognized as a lagged variable.
\item If a variable is defined inside \code{d()}, the \code{sfcr} engines will transform
them into a first difference equation. For example, \code{d(Hh)} is internally transformed
into \code{(Hh - Hh[-1])}.
}

Random variables can be created using the \code{sfcr_random()} function. See
\code{\link{sfcr_random}} for further details.

\examples{
# Endogenous set
equations <- sfcr_set(
  TXs ~ TXd,
  YD ~ W * Ns - TXs,
  Cd ~ alpha1 * YD + alpha2 * Hh[-1],
  Hh ~ YD - Cd + Hh[-1],
  Ns ~ Nd,
  Nd ~ Y / W,
  Cs ~ Cd,
  Gs ~ Gd,
  Y ~ Cs + Gs,
  TXd ~ theta * W * Ns,
  Hs ~ Gd - TXd + Hs[-1]
  )

# Exogenous set
exogenous <- sfcr_set(alpha1 ~ 0.8, alpha2 ~ 0.15)

# Modify an existing set
equations2 <- sfcr_set(equations, Hh ~ Hh[-1] + d(Hs), exclude = 4)

# Add normal random variable
sfcr_set(Ra ~ sfcr_random("rnorm", mean=10, sd=2))
